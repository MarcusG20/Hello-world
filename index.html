    <p>Listed here will be a few things about myself. I am a UAS major. I am also in the United States Airforce Reserves. One big hobby of mine is to play and create music. I play the guitar, drums, bass, piano, and cello. I love to record music too. I have a studio I built at home record all of the music I play. My favorite style of music is 80's rock and metal. I love going to concerts to see bands live. One of my favorite bands is Iron Maiden. Im also in a band with my friends
